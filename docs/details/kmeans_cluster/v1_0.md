# Overview

We expect an `kmeans_cluster` HDF5 group at the root of the file, containing the k-means clustering parameters and results.
The group itself should contain the `parameters` and `results` subgroups.

**Definitions:**

- `in_use`: whether k-means is the chosen clustering method in [`choose_clustering`](../choose_clustering/v1_0.md).
- `num_cells`: number of cells remaining after QC filtering.

# Parameters

`parameters` should contain:

- `k`: a scalar integer specifying the number of clusters to create.

# Results

If `in_use = true`, `results` should contain:

- `clusters`: an integer dataset of length equal to `num_cells`.
  This contains the cluster assignment for each cell, which should lie in `[0, k)`.

  The total number of clusters may be less than `k`, e.g., when there are too few cells.
  For `N` clusters, there should be at least one occurrence of each integer in `[0, N)`.

If `in_use = false`, `clusters` may be absent.
Nonetheless, if it is present, it should follow the constraints listed above.
