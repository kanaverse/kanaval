# Overview

We expect an `pca` HDF5 group at the root of the file, describing how the PCA was performed on the RNA expression matrix.
The group itself contains the `parameters` and `results` subgroups.

**Definitions:**

- `num_cells`: number of cells remaining after QC filtering.
  This is typically determined from the [`quality_control`](../quality_control/v1_0.md) step.

# Parameters 

`parameters` should contain:

- `num_hvgs`: a scalar integer containing the number of highly variable genes to use to compute the PCA.
- `num_pcs`: a scalar integer containing the number of PCs to compute.

# Results

`results` should contain:

- `pcs`: a 2-dimensional float dataset containing the PC coordinates in a row-major layout.
  Each row corresponds to a cell (after QC filtering) and each column corresponds to a PC.
  The total number of rows and columns is defined as `num_cells` and `num_pcs`, respectively.

# History

Added in version 1.0.
