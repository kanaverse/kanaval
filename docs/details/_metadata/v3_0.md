# Overview

The file should contain a `_metadata` group that contains at least the following children:

- `format_version`: a scalar integer specifying the version of the `kana` format. 
  This should be the same as the version number listed in bytes 9-16 of the `kana` file, before the start of the state file.
  We re-specified the version here to allow the state file to be interpreted in a standalone manner.
- `application_name`: a string containing the name of the the application used to generate the file.
- `application_version`: a string containing the version of the application used to generate the file.
