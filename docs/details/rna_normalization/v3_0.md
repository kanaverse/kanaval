# Overview

We expect a `rna_normalization` HDF5 group at the root of the file, describing how the normalization of the RNA count matrix was performed.
The `normalization` group itself contains the `parameters` and `results` subgroups.

# Parameters

No contents are mandated for `parameters`.

# Results

No contents are mandated for `results`.

# Changes from previous version

- This was renamed from `normalization`, to better disambiguate between modalities.
