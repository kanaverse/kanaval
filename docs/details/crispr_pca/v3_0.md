# Overview

We expect a `crispr_pca` HDF5 group at the root of the file, describing how the PCA was performed on the RNA expression matrix.
The group itself contains the `parameters` and `results` subgroups.

**Definitions:**

- `crispr_in_use`: whether CRISPR data is present in the dataset.
  This is typically determined by examining the `inputs` step.
- `num_cells`: number of cells remaining after QC filtering.
  This is typically determined from the `cell_filtering` step.

# Parameters 

`parameters` should contain:

- `num_pcs`: a scalar integer containing the number of PCs to compute.
- `block_method`: a scalar string specifying the method to use when dealing with multiple blocks in the dataset.
  This may be `"none"`, `"regress"` or `"weight"`.

# Results

If `crispr_in_use = false`, `results` should be empty.

Otherwise, `results` should contain:

- `pcs`: a 2-dimensional float dataset containing the PC coordinates in a row-major layout.
  Each row corresponds to a cell (after QC filtering), with `num_cells` rows in total.
  Each column corresponds to a PC, with no more than (but possibly less than) `num_pcs` columns in total.
  PCs may be computed with block-specific weights or regression, depending on `block_method`.
- `var_exp`: a float dataset of length equal to the number of PCs, containing the percentage of variance explained by each PC.
