# Overview

We expect a `snn_graph_cluster` HDF5 group at the root of the file, containing details on the SNN graph-based clustering.
The group itself should contain the `parameters` and `results` subgroups.

**Definitions:**

- `in_use`: whether SNN graph clustering is the chosen method in [`choose_clustering`](../choose_clustering/v1_0.md).
- `num_cells`: number of cells remaining after QC filtering.

# Parameters

`parameters` will contain:

- `k`: a scalar integer specifying the number of nearest neighbors to find.
- `scheme`: a scalar string specifying the edge weighting scheme to use.
  This may be `"rank"`, `"number"` or `"jaccard"`.
- `resolution`: a scalar float specifying the resolution of the multi-level community detection.

# Results

If `in_use = true`, `results` should contain:

- `clusters`: an integer dataset of length equal to `num_cells`, containing the SNN graph cluster assignment for each cell.
  For `N` clusters, there should be at least one occurrence of each integer in `[0, N)`.

If `in_use = false`, `clusters` may be absent.
If it is present, it should follow the constraints listed above.

# History

Added in version 1.0.
